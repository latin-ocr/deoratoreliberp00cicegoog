BOOK 1. CHAP. 28—30. 135

’tradi arte non possit: because the circumstances to which one
must instinctively adapt oneself are so infinitely varied. artis
. . . arte, a play upon the word—aliquando: equivalent to tan-
dem aliquande, as often; cf. II. 24, 99; and 68, 274.

133. alio: i.e. to a mode of treatment or to a province of the
subJ‘ect more suitable to statesmen (like ourselves). — dimittis: as
had been said of Apollonius, 28, 126.—ut nobis . . . potes:
that you explain to us your power as an orator, such as ic is.
In quicquid est istud, Cotta in a vein of playful irony falls
into the disparaging estimates which Crassus has himself ex-
pressed, 24, 111; and follows it up in neque enim sumus nimis
avidi: ista tua mediocri eloquentia contenti sumus;
and quam quantulum.

30. 134. adridens: at the jocose irony of Cotta.— hoc:
answers to nihil, nemo to quisquam, while umquam belongs
to both members. — molesti: urqent.

135. intendas, ferat, etc.: for similar accumulation of verbS‚
see 22, 100; Intr. 9, 11.— exponam vobis non quandam, etc. ι
the form in which the sentence is begun leads the reader to expect
an antithesiS‚—(sed rationem) consuetudinis meae; not
any obscure ον very diffie-ult, etc.‚ one-chod, (but the method) os my
own practice. By a slight change of construction the first member
(completed at rationem) is turned into a negative description of
the method of CraSSUS, upon which after all the writer wishes
mainly to dwell. ’

136. diem: for the case, see A. 240, d; G. 343, 1; Η. 381.—
nec insidiando nec speculando: nor by keenly wacchinq and
observin9; cf. Or. 62, 21οε non enim id ayit ut insidietur ct
observet—non modo . . . sed: a form of expression by which ’
the first thought (videre) is set aside as plainly impossible ; M.
461, b, obs. 23 cf. 52, 225: servire vero non modo te, sed universum
senatum . . . ausus dicere—scriptore: not scriba, which would
mean a clerk by public appointment.—Diphno : one of the servi
litterati employed in literary work3 see Brut. 22, 87: Galbam
. . . commentatum in quadam testudine cum servis litteratis fuisse,
quorum alic· aliud dictare eodem tempore solitus esset. Cicero's
freedman Tiro is the best known of this class — suspicari: ιο
surmise.
