value‚ sent the MS. to Cosmus 01 Cremona and had copies made,
one 01 which he presented to the bishop. Within a few years
the original disappeared and has not since been found.

From these copies of the codex Laudensis are derived directly
or indirectly the large number of now extant later MSS. consti-
tuting a distinct class. Heerdegen is 01 1116 opinion that three
were transcribed directly from the Laudensis‚ viz„ the codex
Florentium, which, however, does not contain de Oratore ; the
codex Palatinus 1469, 111 1116 Vatican library3 and 1116 codex Otto·
bonianus 2057, also in the Vatican. Others, 33 80101 and Fried-
rich, think that they are only indirect copies 01 1116 1031 Lau-
densis. These and the many later MSS. have not as yet been
adequately treated.

As to estimates 01 1116 relative value 01 1116 Μ88., 1116 earliest
editors favored the codices inteyrz' ,· but as it could hardly fail 10
116 noted that the mutili supplied in many passages a better
text, editors soon began to draw sparingly upon them, and the
recognition 01 their higher authority has steadily advanced,
until, 101 1116 passages that they contain, their influence may
now be said to be predominant. Some editors regard the later
complete MSS. as having little value, while 0111613, 33 80101 and
Harnecker‚ think it probable that Cosmus and his scribes
copied the whole codex, and not simply the parts which had re-
mained unknown up to the time 01 113 discovery3 and as the
original was older than the codices mutili, these MSS. must be
diligently collated and carefully classified before the last word
can be said on the text 01 de Oratore. ⁹

The editio princeps was printed at Subiaco 31101111465-1467,
and was followed by many editions; but the era 01 criticism
may be said to have begun with that 01 Ellendt (1840). Since
that time there have appeared many excellent editions, notably
those 01 Piderit, 1859, 1863, 1868, 1873, 1878 (Adler), and 1886
(Harnecker) ; Kayser, 18603 Bake, 1863 ; 80101, 1875, 18823
Cima, 18863 Wilkins, 1879, 1888; Stangl (text only3 critical
apparatus promised “aliquot annis '’), 1893.
