the promotion of a few of their order to the 8611616, while
among the landholding allies there was great anxiety lest the
planting of colonies should interfere with their tenure of public
land. The great mass of the Italiam, however, attached them-
selves to Drusus; and as his proposals were really based upon
a far-sighted policy, and looked beyond the temporary interests
of any single 61666, 116 drew to his support the best elements of
the aristocracy,—-such men as M. Aemilius ScauruS, Princeps
Senatus, Q. Lutatius CatuluS‚ the conqueror of the Cimbri, his
half-brother C. Julius Caesar, the illustrious orators M. Anto-
nius and L. Licinius CrassuS, the augur and Pontifex Maximus
Q. Mucius Scaevola, and, of the younger generation, especially
C. Aurelius Cotta and the talented P. Sulpicius Rufus. At 1116
head of 1116 opposition stood the consul L. Marcius Philippus,
one of the most powerful orators of the time, and Q. Servilius
Caepio. The agitation was 1101 without violence, and the vote
was delayed by every means known 10 Roman politics. The
law as 10 jurymen would doubtless have been rejected ff put 10
vote by itself, but Drusus carried it through by combining it
in one enactment with the more popular proposals concerning
corn 61111 land, 6 proceeding expressly forbidden by the lex
Caecilia Didiav (98 13.c.). This 1611 10 61111 further violence.
At the demand of Philippus the law was annulled by the
wavering Senate, and Drusus soon after fell a victim to the
assassin's knffe. ’ ’

The recurrence of the ludi Romani in the early autumn
(Sept. 4-12) gave a brief respite from these political struggles
and stormy debates. Those who did not share in the popular
taste for the public spectacles1 took advantage of the holidays
to escape for a time from the city, and it is at this point that
Cicero places the conversation inpwhich he presents his theory
of eloquence. All the participants in the supposed conversation
are mentioned above among the partisans of Drusus, and we
may now turn to a more particular consideration of these
characters.
