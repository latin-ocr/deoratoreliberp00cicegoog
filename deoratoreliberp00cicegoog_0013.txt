In the retirement of his studies Cicero turned back fondly to
the consideration of those times which had exercised a most
decisive influence in the development of the ideals of his life.
In the present treatise the dialogue is thrown upon the his-
torical background of events which immediately preceded the

‘social'wan Cicero was just coming to the period of the manly
gown, and must have watched with a keen interest and with
no little intelligence the doings of those eminent characters to
whom he listened with admiration and who were both the
instructors and the models of his youth.

It is no easy matter, if indeed it is at all possible, in the
meagreness of original information upon the period, to present
a clear idea of the historical situation and the exact relation of
political parties.1 It is sufficient to say, in brief, that the great
problem with which, whether consciously or not, Roman states-

* men had to grapple‚ was the transformation of the municipal
institutions of Rome into the constitution of an empire. The
particular questions in which this larger issue took special
form were the admission of the Italian allies to Roman citizen-
ship, and, in view of its relations 10 the government of prov-

had been a prominent question in Roman politics since the
legislation of C. Gracchus (122 B.c.). The consuls of 95 13.c.,
L. Licinius Crassus and Q. Mucius Scaevola, sought to check
the agitation by abridging rather than enlarging their rights,
and passed a law de civibus rediyundiS, prohibiting, under severe
penalties, the citizens of allied towns from claiming the privi-
leges of the franchise. The prosecutions under this law in·
creased the bitterness of feeling and hastened the crisis.

The ‚senatorial party were in turn exasperated by the abuse
of justice on the part of the equestrian courts. Their scan-
dalous misuse of the judicia] power seemed to reach its height
