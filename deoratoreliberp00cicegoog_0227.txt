would then turn upon the people; to which W well remarks that
such an appeal would have been seen at once to be misleading‚ for
the people were not in danger of coming into collision with the
iudices of the questiones perpetuae. The expression is rather to
justify the hyperbole in eripite ex saucibus eorum, and marks the
extreme and almost incredible violence to which they were ex-
posed. See note.

52, 226. debeat, PAS2WHSt‚ Mss.; debet, KSl.

53, 228. hisce, PASHSt; his, KW.

53, 230. pestiferi cives supplicioque digni, bracketed by K.

54, 232. [quasi aestimationem], KAHWS2St ; without bracketS,
1²8¹, Mss. The repetition is harsh3 besideS, aestimatio will hardly
bear the meaning of “penalty assigned,'' which is here given to
it3 and at any rate, the repetition of quasi is uncalled for. W
suggests that poenam be understood with quam.

55, 234. incomptam, answering to the following ornasti, as in-
dotatam to locupletasti, PAWS²HSt3 incomitatam, KS¹. All Mss.
but one have incomitatam et incomptam, the first word of which
may have resulted from a repetition of incomptam.

56, 238. causa, bracketed by KW2.

56, 239. hoc est, non iuris scientia, sed eloquentia, bracketed
by Κ.

quod Crassi filiam 0. filio suo, WS²HSt‚ Msa, and now gen-
erally adopted. Other reading8‚ aS, cuius Ο. filio· suam filiam,
KS1; quod C. filio filiam suam, PA, rest on the supposition that
despondere was only used of the father of the bride, as indeed is
suggested by passages in Cicero (ad Att. I. 3, 33 pro Cluent. 64,
179), and especially by Varr0‚ de Ling. Lat. VI. 71 z qui spospon-
derat filiam despondisse dicebatur. But Varr0‚ as W points out,
seems to have been led to the dictum by an absurd etymology—
quod de sponte eius, i.e. de voluntate exierat ,· and further, Donatus
on Ter. And. I. 1, 75, and Ad. IV. 7, 16, lays down the opposite
rule: spondere dici patrem puellae, a quo illa petitur, despondere
patrem adulescentis qui petit. Neither statement appears to hold
good universally, and in one passage, Cic. ad Fam. VIII. 7, 2, the
phrase despondere is used of the bridegroom.

57, 241. Et enim, after Bake; Attamen, KPAH, MsS.; ac
tamen, WSt. See note.
