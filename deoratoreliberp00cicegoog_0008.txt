(c) Sulpicius.

Cicero has brought into close connection with these masters
two young men 01 great promise, — Sulpicius and Cotta.

P. Sulpicius Rufus, born 124 13.c., was of patrician family,
and in the earlier part of his career roused great hopes in the
party of the optimates that they would have in him an eminent
champion of their principleS,¹ a hope that was disappointed
only by the evident unscrupulousness and incapacity of that
party. Sulpicius, from an ardent partisan of the aristocracy,
became its adversary.² The beginnings of the change may
perhaps be 13160611 to Antony's defense of N orbanus.⁸ He was,
however, in harmony with the best men of the Senate in 91 1³.c.‚
and on terms of intimacy with the tribune M. Livius Drusu8‚
whose design for the complete enfranchisement of the Italians
he approved, as also with Q. Pompeius Rufus,4 who was his
opponent when consul in 88.

In the first year of the Social war he served as legate in the
field,⁶ and in 88 was made tribune of the people, in which office

, his first measures were directed against the Marian party, and

were moderately conservative. He vetoed on constitutional
grounds the proposition, made in the interest of the equites, to
recall all those who had been exiled under the law of Varius3
but he resolutely opposed on the same ground of illegality
C. Julius Caesar Vopiscus in his candidature for the consulship,
as he had not yet been praetor-⁶

. It seems most likely that the change in his political attitude
grew out of his purpose to carry through the reform of Drusm,
and secure the complete enfranchisement of the Italiam. To
this end he must conciliate prejudices‚ and Plutarch tells us
that he went about attended by his anti-senate made up 01 600
