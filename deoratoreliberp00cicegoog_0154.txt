235; ΙΙ. 17, ''IL—a me: i.e. in my savor; = pro me; viz„ when
I say tractationem orationis propriam oratoris esse;
ci. the expression stare ab aliquo, to be on one’s side, speak
sor him. - oum mis communia: for Crassus insiste that this
knowledge oi the emotions and moral principles is a common
possession of the orator and the philosopher. — de his rebus:

vi2.‚as above, de oratione gravi et ornata, etc.
56. loci: topice. —de communi . . . iure: the passage has
