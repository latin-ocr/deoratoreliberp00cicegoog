topics which their taste would prefer and their culture suggest;
just as Cicero found solace and compensation for the loss of
political activity in the resumption of his studies,

men and orators than an inquiry as to the nature and theory
of eloquence, and a more suitable form for the treatise of
Cicero could hardly have been chosen than the one he has
used. According to his own account,1 he is brought to the
choice of this subject by the request of his brother, and there is
no sufficient reason to doubt the correctness of the statement.
Quintus had enjoyed the same training with Marcus,2 and may
well have preserved his interest for a subject in which his
youth had been exercised,⁸ though his career had been devel-
