the spirit and meaning of the law in his favor, and triumphantly
defended the cause of Curio against the legal quibbles of his
opponent, on the grounds of equity.

In the year 92, Crassus was censor with Cn. Domitius Aheno-
barbus, who as tribune in 104 had carried the law concerning
the choice of priests by the people. Attacked by this serious
but stolid1 colleague for his luxury and love of display‚2 Crassus
took his revenge in an admirable altercatio censoria, a defense in
which he gave full play to his effective wit and fine irony.8 On
account of this want of harmony between the two men, their
censorship was in other respects without result, except that they
published a judicial edict against the Latin rhetoricians who fl
had lately made their appearance, and whose mode of instruc-
tion was not acceptable.4

The last effort of Crassus was made in the Senate in the cause
of Drusus,⁵ Sept. 13, 91, when he assailed Philippus in a speech
of great eloquence and power. His death followed in a few
dayS,⁶ and removed one who was signally distinguished for
uprightness of character and purity of sentimentS, and who had
by his gifts as a speaker won so high an eminence that he was
regarded as a peer of the prince of the Senate M. Aemilius
Scaurus!

He was fitted for so commanding a position not only by his
natural gifts, a certain refinement of feeling and intellectual
versatility, but also by that comprehensive scientific training
which he had acquired by a thorough study from youth of
whatever was worth knowing in every department of intellect-
ual activity, but especially of Greek art and knowledge, how-
ever little he was disposed to exhibit his pursuit of the latter
to his own people.⁸ His friendly relations with the poet
Archias⁹ furnish a proof of his efforts in this direction, as also
