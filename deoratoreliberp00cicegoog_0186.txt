causa cadat is qui non quemadmodum oportet egerit,
must have lost his case. But Octaviu8‚ the counsel for the guar-
dian, is equally ignorant of law, and fails to take advantage of the
flaw, but rather exerts himself to prevent the suicidal action of his
opponent (recusaret ne adversarius causa caderet). It
is not easy to determine when this trial took place; probably in
121 B.c., when the Augur Scaevola was in Asia3 hence he adds
(167), memini mihi narrare Mucium—consularis: added
not to distinguish the man, but to make his ignorance seem the
more disgraceful. A guardian convicted in an action of th1s kind
was legally degraded3 hence, turpi tutelae iudicio.

who had to draw up the case for trial. — in XII tabulas: a rule
referred to above, lex actionem adversus tutorem in du-

condicione causa ageretur. — caderet: i.e. cadere eum
oportebat.—secum agi: i.e. lege a se peti; “that more
should be demanded from him.’' -quam quod erat in actione:
“than the law in such cases specified.”

by the soldiers of Cn. Pompeius Strab0. — sedentibus: i. e. as an
assessor, like Scaevola in the trial mentioned above. —illi unde
peteretur: ‘⁴ the defendant.’' —exceptioz a roseo-vacien, a saving
clause, provided for the protection of the plaintifn but introduced
here by the defendant's counsel in ignorance of its real purpose
(quod petitoris causa comparatum esse non intellige-
bat). If the plaintiff demanded a debt before it was due, he
would not only lose his case in that action, but could not bring
action again, quod ea res in iudicium ante venisset. The
reservation‚ cuius pecuniae dies fuisset, was a technical
qualification of his claim that saved him from being bari-ed in a
subsequent action. The defendant in this case makes use of it
only to get a postponement till the debt is due. —- ut . . . ne ex-
cluderetur: ironical‚ like contenderent in 166; that he miyht
not be burred by the reservation (from bringing a second suit),
i.e. this would be the necessary consequence (and quite to his own
