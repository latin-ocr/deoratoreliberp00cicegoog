cm'rchL APPENDIX. 183

42, 191. coquntur, KSW‚ after Ernesti3 coquntur, PAHSt, MsS.
Crassus has a digest of the civil law in contemplation, but it is not
said that he has actually undertaken the work.

48, 192. omnia sunt enim posita, KPSW2St, ος omnia enim sunt
p., AW1H‚ h.

elata sunt, KASWHSt; sunt elata, P.

43, 193. vetustas prisca, KASWHSt 3 prisca vetustas, P.

sive quis civilem scientiam consectatur, SSt, following a conjec-
ture of Wyttenbach; sive quis civilem scientiam θ’, Κ ; sive quem
civilis scientia (sc. delectat), PAWH. The structure of the period
seems to require a distinct verb (see note), whose object, civilem
scientiam, appears in nearly all Mss.‚ and is not easily explained
by corruption of the text. The reading sive quem, instead of sive
quis, occurs only in γ, and in the cod. designated B, by K.

descriptis, KSWH, Mss.; discriptis, PASt; but the thought is
not of distribution, as in 13, 58, but of simple description.

praepotens ista, KSWH; ista praepetem, PASt.

48, 194. quoniam virtus et iustus atque honestus labor, SHSt,
after Capellman; quoniam virtus atque honestus labor, KPAW¹‚
after Wesenberg ; quoniam vera virtus atque honestus labor,
W2‚ after Friedrich. In the Mss. reading (cum verus et iustus
atque honestus labor) the corruption seems to rest upon cum verus,
—cum arising from a misunderstanding of the abbreviation used
for quoniam, and verus probably representing an original virtus.
The substantives honoribus, praemiis, and splendore suggest a
triple distribution of thought in what precedes.

44, 196. tanta est vis ac tanta natura, PAS2HW2St, Mss. ; tanta
est vis [ac tanta] natura, KW13 tanta est vis ac tanta necessitas
natura, Sl.

45, 198. qai, struck out by Madvig (after Rubner), bracketed
in W2. It seems best, however, to retain it. The main thought is
that the Romans have won eminence and distinction by bringing
legal knowledge to the service of others; a comparison of the
means (auctoritas and inqeniu-m) by which this has been brought
about is an incidental matter and properly holds the rank of a
subordinate clause.

inqenio sibi auctore, KSWSt, Mss, ; inqenio sibi, PAH.

45, 199. dicit, S; dicat, KWHSt, Mss.; [dicat], PA.
