This Series will contain the Latin authors usually read in
American schools and college& and also others well adapted to
class-roem use but not published in suitable editions. The
several volumes will be prepared by special editore, who will
aim to revise the text carefully and edit it in the most service-
able manner. Where there are German editions of unusual
merit, representing years of special study under the most favor-
able circumstances, these will be used, with the consent of the
foreign editor, as a basis for the American edition. Iu this
way it will be possible to edit a series of text-books of the
highest excellence in a comparatively short period of time.

The editions will be of two types conforming to the different
ways of reading Latin in our best institutione. Some will con-
tain in the introductions and commentary such a careful and
minute treatment of the author's life, language, and style as to
afford a thoi-ough appreciation of the author and his place in
Latin literature. Others will aim merely to assist the student
to a good reading knowledge of the author and will have only
the text and brief notes at the bottom of each page. These
will be particularly acceptable for sight reading, or for rapid
reading after the minute study of an author or period in one of
the fuller editions, For instance, after a class has read a play
or two of Plautus or Terence carefully with special reference to

. the peculiarities of style, language, metreS, the method of pre-

senting a play and the like, these will be well suited for the

rapid reading of other playS.
