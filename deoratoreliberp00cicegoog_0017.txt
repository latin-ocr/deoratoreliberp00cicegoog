brought forward the proposition that the Senate should be
again included along with othe knights in the roll of the judges.
Crassus availed himself of this opportunity to win the favor of
the Senate by a most powerful speech in favor of the proposi-
tion.1 Nevertheless the law seems to have been rejected3 at
least it by no means follows from Tac. Ann. XII. 60, cum . . .
rursum Serviliae leqes senatui iudicia redderent, that this proposed
law really was passed. Equally unsuccessful was the speech
which it is probable Crassus delivered in defense of Caepi0,
accused by C. Norbanus in the year 104.

As Aedile in 103, he exerted himself to win the favor of the
people by brilliant games‚² while again in 100 he took a de-
cided stand against Saturninus, and with all eminent leaders of
the Senatetook up arms⁸ In succession he became Praetor,
Augur, and in the year 95 Consul along with Q. Mucius Scae-
vola, Pontifex Maximm, who was his colleague in all offices of
state except the tribuneship — which he held a year later than
Crassus—and the censorship, to which the Mucii on principle
never aspired.4 As consuls, they introduced the famous lex
Licinia Mucia de civibus rediyundis, a measure of questionable
wisdom and one followed by doubtful resultS, though it seems
to have served some purpose in allaying the social agitation
for a time. Beyond this it is only to be noted of the consul·
ship of Crassus that he undertook certain expeditioris against
the people of the Alps of Hither Gaul, to win for himself the
honor of a triumph.⁵ The Senate appeared to be weak enough
to yield to this quite unfounded demand,⁶ but it failed through
the vote of his colleague Scaevola. Scaevola two years later
opposed Crassus again in the famous causa Curiana,⁷ and this
time under circumstances far less creditable‚ since Crassus had
