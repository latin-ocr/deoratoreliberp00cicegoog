ample vocabulary, furnishing the materials for duplicatae, made
available by the simple devices of coordination.

In Cicero this goes beyond mere emphasis, and becomes a
matter of movement and rhythm. His sentences vibrate with
paim, in which the added members give differences of meaning
of course, if we insist upon looking into the shades of mean-
ing -- but very often without distinct intention beyond the
rhythmic libration, where there is duplication in the movement
without cumulation of thought3 as, animo et cogitatione, 63
reqere ac yubernare, 83 immensum infinitumque, 223 tribuat et con-
cedat, 48; callide et perite, 483 loquimur et quaerimus, 49 ; tribuam
et dabo, 573 expetenda atque optabilia, 2213 remissius ec lenius, 2553
iunqi copularique, 2223 concesso et tradito, 2353 spolies et denudes,
235, etc., etc„ from one or two, to eight or ten such pairs in
nearly every one of the 265 sections of Book Ι.

This is conspicuously the case in sentences which start out
with a vibratory swing, and the movement is then kept up
through a succession of pairs·

Such a style offers an excellent opportunity for the study of
synonyms; but that method of study applied to a particular
text is likely to inJ’ect more thought into the phrases than the
writer was conscious of. Of course Cicero is accurate and dis·
criminating in his choice of words, but when his sentences fall
into vibration we must not press too hard our search for an
argument in every phrase.

Turn now to note a few variationS, and the methods of secur-
ing the dual cadence in larger groups of particulars.

(a) The libration often extends to the structure in detail of
whole phrases and even clauses3 ae, verbis ad audiendum iucun-
dis et sententiis ad probandum accommodatis, 2133 vestram iniqui-
tatem accusalote . . . meam facilitatem laudatae, 208.

(b) The second member is very often more fully developed,
especially at the close of a peri0d3 aS, suum ius atque omnium
rerum impunitam libertatem tenere, etc„ 226.
