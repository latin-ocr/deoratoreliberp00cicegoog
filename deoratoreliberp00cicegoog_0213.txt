245. illa mffltls causa: 38, 175.—Hostilianas actiones:
a collection of law forum, apparently with reference to wills, by
a jurist Hostilius, otherwise unknown. -- tu vero: corrective;
“nay, rather, you would plead the cause with earnestness and
feeling, as though the validity of all wills were at stake in this
trial.'’—ut soles: with reference, doubtleSS, to Cicero’s own prac-
tice of producing powerful effects by personification. — a mortuis
excitasses: i.e. to be a present witness. In the use of the plup.
subj. Antony turns from the general supposition of the preceding
passage to the particular instance in past time. For the thought,
cf. Top. 10, 45: in hoc yenerc oratoribus ec philosophis conoessum
esc, ut muta etiam loquantur, ut mortui ab inseris excommun Or.

ab inseris mortuos excitabat. —coegissosz as the climax produced
in favor of the son. -— uti ungua'nuncupassit: in fuller form,

learn and full of pleasure, are followed by their own refutation,
as it were parenthetically. —ediscantz A. 320, ο; G. 6335 H. 503.
-viderint . . . videris: a formula of disavowal, throwing the
burden of proof or explanation on others; cf. ΙΙ. 58, 235: viderit
Democritus. -elus artis: i.e. because of their knowledge of this
art.— quasi . . . ita: just as thouyh. — facilem esse dicisz
see 41, 185. — esse illam artem flaturam: dependent upon
dicis, to be supplied from concedis3 deinde quod sit, etc.:
answers to primum facillimam, but takes the form of a second
reason why that branch of knowledge should be pursued, as
though some such statement as artem istam ediscendam
censes had introduced the whole—in quo: i.e. in qua ree
in respect ιο which. —si iam sit, etc.= ff they should have to learn
