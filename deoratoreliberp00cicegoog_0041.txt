The manuscripts of de Oratore fall easily into two classes,
the codices mutili and the codices inteyri. At the close of the
M iddle Ages, only the former— incomplete copies—were known,
of which several are still extant. The oldest, and in some re-
spects the most important, is the codex Abrincensis of the ninth
’ century, at Avranches, which containS, however, no portione of
Book Ι. Next to this is the codex Erlanyensis of the tenth
century, in the public library at Erlangen. This contains, of
Book 1.‚ 1-123‚ coyitanti . . . causas; and 157-193‚ exercitatione
. . . civili. With these should be mentioned the codex Harlei·
αηιιε, also probably of the tenth century, in the British Mu-
seum. This contains, of Book 1., 1-123 as above; 123-128,
invenibam . . . paene summo (rum); and 157-193 as above. A
later class of codices mutili includes the codem Gudianus, in the
library at Wolfenbiittel, collated by Dr. Sorof, containing of
Book 1.‚ 1-128, coquam· . . . summo (ram), and 157-193 as
above; and the lectiones Laqomarsinianae, a body of critical
materials collected by Hieronymus Lagomarsini about the
middle of the last century, and which have considerable value.

The codices integri date from a very important discovery in
the early part of the fifteenth century, the story of which may
be here briefly told. A scholar at Milan, Gasparino Barziza,
was diligently studying the codices mutili in the attempt to fill
up the lacunae in the books de Oratore. Gherardo Landriani,
bishop of Lodi, while searching for some old documents in his
cathedral, opened a chest that had long been unused‚ and found
(1422) a very ancient MS. containing not only the de Oratore,
but the Brutus —then discovered for the first time, the Orator —
hitherto known only in fragments, the two books de Inventione,
and the four books rhetoricorum ad Herennium complete. This
codex (known as Laudensis) Landriani at once handed over to
Barziza, in furtherance of the enterprise in which he was en-
gaged. The ancient writing was hardly intelligible to the
scholars of Milan, and Barziza, easily recognizing its probable
