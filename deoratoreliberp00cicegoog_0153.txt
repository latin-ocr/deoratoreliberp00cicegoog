Boon 1. GHAP. 11-13. 111

represents the Greek ῥητορικοὶ διδάσκαλοι, a class of teachers some-
what unfamiliar as yet to the Romans.

53. Quae: viz., the above results of oratorical activity. For
the government of quae the reader is led to expect some such
form as praestare non poterit3 but the length of the inter-
vening sentence makes it necessary for the clear development of
the thought to repeat the obJ‘ect, and it takes the form of a clause
(quod volet), while the foreshadowed verb becomes perficere.
The anacoluthon is not uncommon, but many editors have sought
to simplify the sentence by substituting quare for the quae of
the MSS„ and Piderit gives quoad for quod, which is not
followed, however, by Harnecker.— quod volet: his aim. For
similar circumlocution see 3, 10: quod voluerit consecutus sit ;
5, 19: quod expetunt consequi ; 26, 118: quod quaerimus omittere ,·
30, 135: quo intendaS, etc. For the tense of volet, see A. 278, b;
G. 242, R. 13 H. 470, 2. The English admits of the present in
such subordinate propositions ; “ he will not be able to accomplish
what he wishe3.” — humanitatis: used in a sense different from
that in 8, 32, - “the whole-range of human sentimentS.”

54. Atque: and indeed (in a tone of concession). -locum
topic, viz., with respect to the passionS.— me auctore: “with my
advice ’⁹ 3 cf. 59, 251 3 III. 14, 54: Qua re istos omnis me auctore
deridete. —voluerintz for the mood, see A. 321 ; G. 541 ; Η. 516,

’ II. —tractationem orationis: treatment by means os speech ,·

i.e. the power to express and produce feeling by speech, not the
development of the theory of the emotions. — ffla scientia: for
illarum rerum scientia. —nulla: see on 12, 50.—adsumet:
he will take in addition. The orator may leave systematic dis-
cussions of the sensibilities to the philosopher, but he must not be
without a knowledge of the subject, and besides, must be able to
adapt his speech to the purposes of producing and controlling the
emotions. - gravis: impres-sive.

13. 55. Quibus de rebus: viz., concerning oratio gravis
et ornata, etc. The paragraph as far as appellant is a digres-
sion to meet a possible objection, after which the thought is
resumed. —Arlstotelemz in his Rhetoric. The treatise of Theo-

phrastus, περὶ λέξεως, is lost. —— vide ne: a polite form to introduce
a mild assertion; see G. 548, N. 43 M. 372, b. obs. 13 and cf. 55,
