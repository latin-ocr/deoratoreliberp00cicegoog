ris . . . tristitia sermonis: the lively social discourse and genial
manner of Crassus produce here one of the very effects attributed

χαριεστάτη ὑπὸ τῆς πλατάνου. - crevisse: Cicero could hardly
have intended to suggest a doubt as to the existence of the trec,
but rather that it owed its (reputed) size and beauty to the words
of Plato (τὴν ὑψηλοτάτην ‘thav-avom μαλ’ ἀμφιλαφής τε καὶ ὑψηλή);
i.e. it was not really as large and fine as Plato described it. Pid.
