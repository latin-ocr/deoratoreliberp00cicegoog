equites. Certain it is that he brought forward again the propo-
sition for the recall of the exiles with some slight but significant
change in the wording of the law, -— non exsules sed vi eiectos se
reducere dicebat}

To the same purpose no doubt—for creditore were mainly
of the equestrian order— was the law that no one should be
a senator who owed more than 2000 denarii, and he would
probably have filled the vacancies thus created from the ranke
of the equites.

When, however, his main law, which provided ut novi cives
libertinique in omnis tribus distribuerentur, was proposed to the
people, the consuls Sulla and Pompeius Rufus proclaimed a
iustitium, or suspension of all public business for religious
observanceS. Sulpicius and his followers resorted to force and
a riot ensued. The lives of the consuls were in danger. Sulla
canceled the iustitium and escaped to his army at Nola. Then
the law was passed and Sulpicius came forward with another, —
ut Sullae imperium abroqaretur, C. Mario privato pro consule pro-
vincia Asia et bellum decerneretur M itkridaticum.2 Sulla marched
upon Rome with six legions, and after a bloody struggle made
himself master of the city. MariuS, SulpiciuS, and ten other
leaders were proscribed. Marius escaped for a time, but Sul-
picius was killed at Laurentum, his hiding place having been
betrayed by a slave.⁸

Sulpicius possessed in a high degree the qualities which con-

nature both mental and physical,⁴ he added that trainin g which
develops keen insight, clear and correct judgment, and easy
grace in delivery. Exuberances in thought and diction, faults
quite natural to one gifted with vivid fancy, and powers so
quick and active, he promptly corrected by making a model
of Crassus.⁵ Cicero speaks of him⁶ as the grandest and, so to
