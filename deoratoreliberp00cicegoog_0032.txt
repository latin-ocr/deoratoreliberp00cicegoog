on the grass, while Crassus, quite in harmony with his tendency
to the comfortable enjoyment of life, had cushions brought for
his guests.¹

On the following day they converse upon more special topics,
devoting the whole day to the discussion. The aged Scaevola
had taken his departure the preceding evening,² and Catulus
and Caesar are added to the party, men who bring new interest
to the interview by their scholarly attainments and their ability
to furnish technical information as the need ariseS. The lead-
ing part of the forenoon falls to Antony, who, a master in the
discovery and distribution of subject matter, and a man of
remarkable memory,⁸ naturally treats of inventio, dispositio, and
memoria, in the meantime touching incidentally upon points
treated by Crassus the preceding day. The discourse is varied
by a graceful interruption by Caesar, a man eminently endowed
with a fine sense of humor, who talks of wit in itsrelations to
oratory, giving numerous specimens.

Not without some reference perhaps to the topics of the
morning, the soene of the interview is not the shaded slope
as on the preceding day, but the colonnade‚4 whose well-built
walls and symmetrical columns suggest strength, order, and
permanence. After a midday period of reposo, which Crassus
devotes rather *to meditation than to sleep,⁵ they meet again
and repair to a beautiful grove? at some distance from the
house, where ·in the pleasant shade, surrounded by “nature
beautified,'’ Crassus completos the treatise in a discourse upon
style and delivery. Thus, without the severe formality of the
drama, we have in the graceful and easy variation of character
and scene all the pleasant effects of dramatic presentation with-
out the sacrifice of unity of treatment, a work in which the
author displays a refined taste and consummate art, no less

than a comprehensive mastery of his subject.
