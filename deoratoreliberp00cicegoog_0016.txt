(a) Crassus

L. Licinius Crassus was born 140 13.c., in the consulship of
Q. Servilius Caepio and C. Laelius Sapiens.¹ His parentage is
not known. He married Mucia, daughter of Q. Mucius Scae-
vola Augur, and Laelia.‘·³ His wife was already dead in 91,
having borne him two daughterS,²3 one of whom was married to
P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica. ,

Crassus came forward early as a public speaker, his first case
being the prosecution of C. Papirius Carbo in 119, apparently
for the part he took in the Gracchan agitation, although Carbo
had later gone over to the optimates, and had in his consulship
(120 3.οὸ even defended L. OpimiuS, charged with responsi-
bility for the cruel measures against C. Gracchus and his
partisans.4 The prosecution was pressed with so much vigor
and effect that Carb0, as Cicero says,⁵ committed suicide. In
the following year, 118, he advocated in the popular interest⁶
the proposition for the founding of a colony at Narbo Martius
in Gallia Transalpina, recently subdued, and, notwithstanding
the opposition of the Senate, carried his proposal,⁷ and received
himself the commission to found the colony. Less successful
was his defense, in 113 13.c., of the Vestal Licinia, accused of
unchastity, who with several* other Vestals was condemned.⁸

Four years later (109) Crassus filled the quaestorship in
Asia, and had intercourse there, as well as at Athens, on his
return with the most renowned philosophers and teachers of
rhetoric of that time.⁹

In 107 B.c. he held the tribuneship‚ but it apparently
brought him into no special prominence.1⁰ More important
again was the year 106, in which the consul Q. Servilius Caepio
