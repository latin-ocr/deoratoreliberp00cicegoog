problems which the world presente requires a general survey of the
whole field of knowledge. — disserendi ratione: dialectics. Cf.
Tusc. Disp. V. 25, 72: Sequitur tertia, quae per omnes partes sapt·-
entiae manat et funditur, quae rem definit, yenera dispertit, sequen-
tia adiuuyit, perfecta concludit, vera et salsa diiudicat, disserendi
ratio et scientia.

10. obscuritate: the subst. instead of the adJ‘., to make the
quality prominent; in what obscure subjecta and in how abstract
ancl complex aud subtle an art, they are enqayecl. — subtili:
παρη requiring acuteneSS. — ei scientiae: used for eius artis
screntiae. —vehementiusz at all earnestly. —- musicis: the
plur. as in 42, 1873 111. 21, 783 elsewhere the sing„ asin 111. 33,
132. Similarly Cicero uses grammatica, dialectica, geo-
m etric a, both as fem. sing. and as neut. plur. — huic: “ now so
sashionable.'’ Literary studies answering about to our Philology‘
(see 42, 187) became very popular at Rome under the influence of
L. Aelius Stilo, the teacher of Cicer0, and Varr0. —vim: ranae.
——- scientia et cognitione: an instance of hysteron „ptOtQL'Qh as
in 35,161: nosse atque vidisse, · see Intr. 9, 1, r; here perhaps for

- the sake of the chiasmuS, since scientia refers to materiem

cognitione to vitn3 seeA. 385, G. 6823 H. 636, V. 2.

’ 11. liberalissimis: drawn into agreement with studiis and
doctrinis, instead of artium, by hypallage, A. 385; G. 693,
H. 636, IV. 2. - Atque (not atqui), as in 9, 38, serves simply to
introduce that which completes the development of the thought. -—
in hoc ipso numero, i.e. in poetarum ipsorum numer0.——
comparare: pregnant, for comparandi causa deligere3 “if
you will select for comparison.'’ So, often, defendere = def en·
dendi causa dicere; turbare bellum= rebus turbandis
bellum efficere. —multo tamen, etc.: we should expect
multo tamen plures egregii reperientur quam sunt
oratores boni; but Cicero's thought gravitates to the fewness
of orators and the intervening clause permits the anacoluthon.

12. mirabilius: the more remarkable. —studiaz knowledqe
gained by study, the cause put for the effect. —reconditiffl
hidden, as opposed to in medio posita, open to all,· abditis„
inaccessible, opposed to communi quodam in usu—quodam:
“ to some extent ;'’¹ quidam (like the Greek τὶς) following an
