XXX ΙΝ TRODUCTION.

While, however, Aristotle treats not only the γένος δικανικόν,
and συμβουλευτικόν, but also the ἔπιδεικτικόν, Cicero, following
probably the traditional rhetoric 01 1113 1311118, gives only inci-
dental attention to the last.

He speaks with some dispar-agement 1 01 13118 system 01 Η81-
magmas, yet acknowledges its utility 101 preparatory training,²
and has even made more use 01 113 1311811 118 13 1113Ρο3811 130 admit.
He has not only retained, 101· example, the entire scheme in its
main outlines, with a slight variation in the order, but also in
detail, especially in the theory-of„- 13118 status, ‚has evidently bor-
rowed chiefly froffiffisffififf in reading what he says 01 memoria
111 Book Π., 81111 01 elocutio and actio in Book ΙΙΙ., 13118 impression
frequently arises that the traditional systems were had in mind.

A notable advance was made upon these 11181111813, however,
not only by the omission 01 many formal details with which
the rhetorical treatises since Hermagoras were filled, but by
giving more precise and scientific 'expression to essential point5‚
by laying due emphasis upon the need 01 broad culture and
practice, and by 13118 power 01 13118 master orator to rise 0111301

, which Cicero derives from his own experienoe‚ the enriohment
01 13118 whole from his vast and varied stores 01 knowledge in
nearly every department 01 8118181113 literature, and the numerous
and full references to the public 1118 01 13118 Romans. In allow-
ing the speakers by way 01 illustrating and confirming their
vieWS, to refer 130, and relate passages in their own experience,
he has imparted a peculiar charm to the treatise‚ and 118311183,
