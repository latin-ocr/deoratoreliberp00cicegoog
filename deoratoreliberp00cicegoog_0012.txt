which he had risen-to the highest eminence. At the age of
fifty-one, mature, but still in the vigor of his prime, already
the acknowledged master of Roman style, he chose as the
subject of his first great literary effort that theme which lay
nearest to the interest-s and activities of his life, to which he
could bring both profound conviction derived from experience,
and the richest fruits of culture.

If he had been left to his own choice, doubtless he would
have preferred to resume a public career in which he had won
such honorable distinction3 and the popular recognition of his
services fostered his hopes in that direction. But the mag-
nificent reception given him on his return from exile (Sept,
57 13.c.) could hardly have closed his eyes to the fact that the
Triumvirate and not the people were supreme, and that among
those who were at the moment all-powerful there was no place
where he might exert himself. During the year following his
return, with intervals of retirement he devoted considerable
time to forensic duties at Rome, and several important
speeches of that period are still extant. The next year was
one of more complete retirement, spent at his villaS, mainly at
Puteoli, during which he devoted himself with characteristic
industry and enthusiasm to literary labors. His letters show
that he finished de Oratore in the autumn of that year (55 13.c.).
To Lentulus Spinther in September he writes (ad Fam. I.
9, 23) : Quod roqas, ut mea tibi scripta mittam, quae post discessum
tuum scripserim, sunt orationes quaedam, quas Menocrito dabo,
neque ita multae, ne pertimescas. Scripsi etiam—nam me iam ab
orationibus diiungo fere referoque ad mansuetiores Musas, quae me
maxime sicut iam a prima adulescentia delectarunt—scripsi igitur
Aristotelio more, quem ad modum quidem volui, tres libros . . . de
oratore quos arbitror Lentulo tuo fore non inutilis ,· abhorrent enim
a communibus praeceptis et omnem antiquorum et Aristoteliam et
Isocrateam rationem oratoriam complectuntur. And to Atticus in
November of the same year (ad Att. IV. 13, 2): De libris orato-
riis factum est a me diliyenter: diu multumque in manibus fuerunt;
describas licet.
