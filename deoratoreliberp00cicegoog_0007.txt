INTRODUCTION. XV

plea.1 Two years later he was killed by the order of MariuS,
a task which the cruel messengers found a difficult one, so much
were they affected by the charms of his eloquence.²

Antony’s ideal in oratory was quite unlike that of CrassuS‚
inasmuch as the latter was a master in the ‘more formal and
theoretical pheses of his art, while the former was more practical,
and aimed rather to give direct and cogent utterance to his
exact thought than to dress it in any special graces of style.
Resides the manual (libellus de ratione dicendi) composed in
his youth,⁸ he committed nothing to writing, assigning as his
reason, so far as his speeches were concerned, that he did not
wish to bc confronted⁸ with his written words when he cared
to deny anythin g that he had said.4

The traits most essential for the orator, according to Antony‚
were sagacity, readiness, decision, and experience, qualities which
he himself possessed in the highest degree.⁵ He attached great
importance to the invention, the careful selection, and ¹⁴mar-
shaling of his material. He aimed to be able to note the criti-
cal points in a trial, to place favorable considerations in the
best light, and keep the unfavorable out of view‚⁶ and in case of
error to be able to withdraw in such a way as to seem to be still
on the offensive.⁷ His language was correct, but chosen rather
with a view to its force than its beauty.⁸ Although laborious
in preparation, a ready and tenacious memory enabled him to
speak with freedom and without the appearance of elaborate
forethought or study.⁹ His voice, naturally harsh, was yet
strong and well suited to passionate or pathetic utterance; and
to this he added the force of appropriate and energetic action,1⁰ so
that in animated speech his eloquence was well-nigh irresistible.
