Roman oratory owes to Crassus a powerful impulse in many

polish and grace in language and delivery. His speeches were
marked by wealth of ideaS, clear statement, and an abundance
of illustration.² His mode of expression was as simple and
natural as it was choice; his sentences were constructed with
careful art, but with a preference for the brief and incisive
rather than the rounded periodic form.⁸

for him to undertake the most varied exerciseS, so that he was
distinguished in judicia] as well as in political oratory. He re-

from the Cimbri the year before, on a charge de maiestate. The
prosecution was conducted with such success that Carbo com-
