BOOK 1. CHAP. 9, ιο. 103

pater: the father of the Gracchi, Tib. SemproniuS, son-in-law of the
elder Scipio, twice Consul, and Censor in 169, when, though other-
wise distinguished, he performed his chief service in so manipulating
the vote of the freedmen as to minimize their political influence. --
nutu: by a nod ,⁰ i.e. by the mere expression oi his will. —verbm
by a sinyle word‚· cf. II. 7, 27· neque Antonium verbum facere
patiar et ipse obmutescam ,· 66, 268: . . . cum parva re et saepe
verbo res obscura et latens illustratur. unus is similarly omitted
often with vox and words denoting time, aS, annus, mensiS,
dies, etQ—urbanas tribus: probably to the single city tribe,
the Esquilina. The limitation to the four tribus urbanae
had been brought about in 304 n.c. by the Censor Q. Fabius
Maximus Rullianus3 cf. Liv. XLV. 15. —- quam nunc vix tene·
mus: in view of the serious disorders of the time, especially the
disturbances caused by Saturninus and Glaucia, and the disgrace-

as in 2, 83 Brut. 27, 106: quae (quaestiones perpetuae) antea
nullae suerunt,· in Cat. 1⁴.. 7, 6: misericordia quae tibi nulla

hence ut aie„ as you suppose. —gubematricez the appositive
placed before the noun to which it belongs (eloquentia), as

iudicis nostri, fortissimi viri, M. Catonis. -’- dissipaverunt:
squandered; with reference to the distribution of public lands by
agrarian'laws3 cf. Phil. ΙΙ. 3, 6: cum tu reliquias reipublicae
dissipavisses. „Cicero varies in his estimate of the Gracchi and
their measureS, though we must remember that he is here putting
words into the mouth of Scaevola. A more favorable opinion is

expressed in de Leg. Agr. II. ὃ, 10: non sum autem eqo is consul ·

qui ut plerique nefas esse arbitrer Gracchos laudare, quorum
consiliis sapientia leyibus multas esse video reipublicae part-es esse
constitutas.

10. 39. Quid: see on 9, 37.— moresque maiorum: ‘⁴ the
