haste3 de libris oratoriis, he says (ad Att. IV. 13, 2), factum est a

While the language is adapted, in some measure, to individ-
ual peculiarities and pursuits‚ there 18, growing out of the
character and eminence of the persons speaking, a tone of re-
finement and elevated courtesy‚ sostened by the delightful ease
and grace of familiar conversation, so that we have here at its
best that peculiar charm of style which has made Cicero the
model of the best Latinity. In the type of Latin with which
he has made us familiar we look for clearness and force, but
with little impression of haste 01· condensation. His periods
are rich and full, and flow smoothly, with the easy grace of
leisure.

(1) What I have called librati0n1 contributes very largely to
this rhythm. I mean by that, the balancing of related parts of
sentenceS‚ and the grouping of ideas and synonyms in pairs.
The pulse of the periods beats in double throbs; there is a vi-
bratory action, a measured rise and fall in the movement‚ which
does not answer to the two directions of accent, or to the alter-
nations of quantity. It would hardly be possible to open the de
Oratore without finding abundant illustration of what is meant.
We note everywhere, not only the graceful adjustment of part
to part in sentence-building, but the doubling of the elements
of a sentence, —subject, verb, adjunct, — which seems the result
of a cultivated preference for the dual cadence‚

There is a natural tendency in emphatic speech, to re-in-
force meaning by repetition, or double strokes3 and it is 111 the
nature of expression, further, to seek clearness and emphasis by
throwing parts of sentences into the attitude of correlation.
This we’find 111 311 languageS, but the Latin in particular de-
veloped an elaborate machinery for the production of the dual
cadence‚ —- first, in the particles which throw clauses and phrases
into correlation, and admit them in pairs, as eo . . . quo, ita
