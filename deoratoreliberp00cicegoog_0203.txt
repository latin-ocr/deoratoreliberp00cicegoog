statesman, and voluminous writer. We have only fragmentS‚
mainly of his most important work, περὶ φύσεως. —proprlaz that
which really is their own. That they claim everything as their
own, and yet do not include geometry and music, would seem to
involve a contradiction; hence the suggestion to insert paene
before omnia, as in49‚ 2125 but qui omnia volunt is a loose
assertion which need cause no trouble.

218. si iam placet: ‘U' it is however your pleasure; cf. 58,
2503 II. 6, 25: si iam mihi disputandum sit‚· III. 22, 84: si iam
me vultis esse oratorem. — sic dicere ut . . . sit boni oratoris:
see on 25, 115: ut. . . possim—nuda: bare ; adspersa: seasoned.
— distincta: decked out, corresponding to nuda.—neque =
neque tamen, as in ll, tim—possedisse: from possi-dc.—
libasse: see on 34, 159.—callidum: elever. — peregrinum at-
que hospitem: sc. nulla in re. On the other hand, familiarity
is expressed by words that denote dwelling3 as habitare ; cf. ΙΙ.
38, 16οε illi autem . . . habitarunt in hac una ratione tractanda.
—1n agendo: i.e. in causa agenda.

where the word rather takes the sense of pathetic declamation.

sostened by quibus uti philosophi maxime solent.—eo
maxime: the ablative without in, as in de Off. I. 20, 66: omnino
sortis animus et mayn-us duabus rebus maxime cernitur. — cerna-
tur: the pres. instead of the imp. after audirent, because
Antony is not merely stating the view of CrassuS‚ but also ex-
pressing his own opinion. — rerum omnium naturam: a humor·
ous exaggeration on Antony’s part, perhaps to ridicule the claims
of philosophers. The nature of the motus animorum, rather
than the nature omnium rerum, would be what the orator
requires with a view to kindling and quenching emotion (mentis
inflammare aut restinguere). BesideS‚ the concession of
CrassuS‚ 15, 68, would make this remark, if seriouS‚ seem far-
fetched and uncandid. -rationes: modes os thouqht, principles.
—penitus perspexerit: see 011 5, 17: penitus pernoscendi. —
quoque: belongs to the predicate. The connection is: ac vide-
mus quoque in eo studiO. . .esse contritas; cf. II. 11,
47: de numero quoque est ercensendam,- and 20, 85: si vir quoque
