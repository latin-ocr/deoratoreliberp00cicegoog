(c) On the other hand, where more exact rhythmic balance
is desired, it is secured by attaching common adjuncta partly to
one' and partly to the other member3 as, plura proferre possim
detrimenta publicis rebus, quam adiumenta per homines eloquentissi-
mos importata, 38.

(d) The terms of the first member are reversed in the second ;
aS, iuris peritorum eloquentissimus, eloquentium iuris peritissimus,
180.

(e) Pairs occur within pairs. A frequent example is where
a second member connected by aut contains a subordinate pair
similarly connected3 aS, ne aut de C. Laeli soceri mei aut de
huius yeneri, aut arte aut gloria detraham, 35.

( f) In the management of larger groups of » particulam,
when they are subjects which require discussion, they are fre-
quently introduced in pairs3 as, quis musicis quis huic studio lit-
terarum, 10:

(9) When mention is all that is required, the mere list still
bears evident traces of libration, the vibratory grouping being
determined by similarity or contrast of meaning3 as, ut de dis
immortalibus de pietate, de concordia de amicitia, etc„ 56, a final
item, not in libration, as in this example (de omni virtutis
genere), being added to sum up the preceding pairs.

(h) The series of particulars at times presents a climacterie
gradation, and yet easily falls into the vibratory swing; as, ’
vitia autem hominum atque fraudes, damnis, iynominiis, vinclis,

’ verberibus, exsiliis, morte, multantur, etc., 194.

(i) In formal libration the second member is sometimes
broken into a pail-3 as, non modo acute sed etiam ridicule et
facete, 243.

(k) In such cases the enlargement of the single member
often balances a lighter pail-3 ae, neque minus haec tamen tua
yravissimi sermonis lenitas, quam illa summa vis et contentio proba·
tur, 255. '

(l) Even without the forms of libration a difference of con-
nective often puts the items of apparent triplets on a slightly
different footing, the result being some variation of the dual
