I'r has been the habit of the learned world to read with
delight nearly everything that has come from Cicero’s pen, -—
pleadingS‚ lettere, essays in morale, in philosophy, and in
rhetoric; but for obvious reasons what the peerless orator had
to say about his own art has justly been held in highest
esteem. Among these treatises the de Oratore is entitled to
the first place, both by the value and interest of the subject-
matter and its literary finish. It stands practically (56-55
n.c.) at. the opening of his literary career. He had long before
prepared a little essay on rhetoric which he now characterized
as rudia ac incohata;¹ he had written a few of his letters3 he
had delivered many great oratione, and had gone through a
career of public office made notable by brilliant aohievements
in stateeraft‚ but the great monuments of his literature were
yet to be reared — the fruit of those periodo of enforeed
inactivity when he sought relies from the contemplation of
public calamity, and the sadness of 1113 disappointed hope& by
turning to the chosen 'studies of his youth. ,

· It is not without interest to note that the first of these works
should be that in which he exhibits‚ not simply the results of
reading, but the ripe fruita of 1113 own experience in an art by
