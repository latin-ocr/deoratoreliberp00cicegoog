The de Oratore is a finished literary work, and therefore in
outward form presents a wide departure from the technical
method which prevailed in the rhetorical manuale of the time,
of which the treatise ad Herenniuml is a good specimen. So

with regard to the subject-matter Cicero paid little heed to his ’

immediate predecessore, and went rather back to Aristotle and
IsocrateS, the former of whom had in his Rhetoric given a
systematic form to the theory of eloquence, having given special
attention to the materials of oratory3 while Isocrates had de-
veloped practically and theoretically the formal side of the
subject.
. This eclectio course had been pursued before Cicero, especially
by Hermagoras of TemnOS, by whom the system of rhetoric
prevalent till Cicero’s time was determined3 so that in him the
Aristotelian as well as the Isocratic school was represented.
The composers of manuals, however, usually drew their matter
only from their immediate predecessors, while Cicero, as has
been said, went back to the original sources.

There can be little doubt that he was familiar with the
Rhetoric of Aristotle at first hand. He quotes passages with

· more or less accuracy, and must have learned from the orig-

inal the philosopher’s summaries of former rhetorical sys-
temS.²

It need not be insisted either that he always accurately
presented the system of Aristotle‚ or perfectly comprehended
it. He hardly had the philosophical depth and acumen for such
a task, and his purpose was better accomplished by adaptin g·
such main features as could easily be gleaned in a rapid reading.
But it is a significant fact that the use of Aristotle is especially
evident in those parts in which the work goes into greatest
detail, viz„ in the treatment of inventio and collocatio in Book 11.
