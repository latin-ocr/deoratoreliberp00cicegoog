undertakiu9.— ambitione: i.e. honorum petitione.— eon-
ficere: cf. 21, 94, where obruere is used to express a similar
thought.

79. tantum in nobis: cf. 27, 123: ut in quoque plurimum
esset. Slightly different, and more in accordance with Cicero’s
usage, is 11. 1, 4: suit hoc in utroque ,· II. 2, 6: eloquentiam qualis
suit in Crasso et Antonio, where the expression is used of a special
characteristic or gift. — doctrina: thorouyh trainiuq. — studium
illud discendi acerrimum: that most eayer desire sor iearuiuy.
—- defuit: repeated, as is regular with the common predicate of a
negative and positive sentence which form a contrast; cf. Tuse.
Disp. I. 48, 116: Cui rationes eae, quae exquisitius a philosophis
conliyuncum defuerunt, ubertas orationis uon defuit ,· also III. 5,
11: eius modi est ui furor in sapientem cadere possit, uon possit
insania. — si ad alieuius, etc. : it· those attaiuments which I have
not (required should be added to the even ,cy-reatem· (leuius os some onan
(yet to arise) ; alicuius: Cicero’s obvious allusion to himself.

18. 80. rationem naturamque : a similar grouping of gov-
erning and dependent nouns in pairs is seen in 25, 114, confor-
matio . . . corporiS, with the difference that here there is
chiasmus (A. 344, f; G. 6823 H. 562); rationem, system, going
with artium, naturam with rerum3 Intr. 9, 1, p.

81. praesertim: see on 6, 21.—Aliud: (i.e. alienum ab usu
foren si ;) emphati03 quite another kind os speech, that of those
men whom you just now mentioued, seems to me to be. —eorum
hominum: see 11, 49.-n1tidum . . . laetum: pozished . . . florid.
In the former the figure is that of a sleek, well-fed, and well-
groomed animal (Hor. Ep. 1. 4, 15) ; in the latter that of luxuriant
plant growth, as laetae segetes, III. 38, 155. nitidum is
especially suited to the following palaestrae et olei.

82. Namque: the reason which namque leads us to expect is
not formally stated, but is contained in 83, viz., the opinion of the
Greeks, especially Mnesarchus), that the orator must be a man of
true wisdom. The passage is loosely constructed (perhaps to
keep up the impression of informal conversation), and 82 is
logically unimportant.— qui attigissem: for the mood, see A.
