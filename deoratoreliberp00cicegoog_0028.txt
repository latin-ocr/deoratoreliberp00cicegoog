owed his eminence in oratory‚ first of all, to his extensive pur-
suit of philosophical, juristic, and historical studies, to which

he had been devoted from his early youth. In doing this he '

conducted the Romans back to those sources which must ever
be the means of intellectual quickening and training,— the
products of 'Greek literature. Here he arrives at that point
where his most important task, his universal mission, begins.
He was not destined as a statesman to change existing condi-
tions and introduce a new order of things, but rather selected
as the instrument to bring Greek learning home to the Roman
genius‚1 and transmit the Greek idea of culture to posterity.
No other Roman possessed such familiarity with all branches
of Greek art and learning, or made such earnest endeavors to
give it a footing in Roman soil.

What he asserted ten years later with reference to his philo-
sophical writings—that he wished to prove himself useful to

‘ his fellow-citizens through them, in his leisure 2— applies to all

his writingS, to none more than the three books de Oratore, in
which a wealth of most valuable material for training was
brought to his people. Furthermore, Cicero owed it not only
to his contemporaries but to his own fame, to prepare a new
treatise on oratory‚ sin*ce the theory developed in de Inventione,
written in his youth, had been superseded in the standard of
his own practice3 although even in that treatise, he had in
single pointS, made advances upon the customary systems
of rhetoric, and had directed attention to the classical models
of the Greeks-⁸ This youthful essay, however, as he himself
suggestS,⁴ in no respect answers to the oratorical perfection
which we see realized in his maturer efforts3 but in de Oratore
he has supplied to the learned world a work which, while it
does not aim to elaborate in full detail a system of rhetoric,
gives evidence, not only of the most comprehensive knowledge
of the subJect, theoretical and practical, but of a fine intel-
