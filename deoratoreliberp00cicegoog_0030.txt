Although Cicero keeps himself quite in the background, it is
easy to see that Crassus must, in the main, be regarded as the
representative of his views. He would be drawn to Crassus
by a certain congeniality of temper and taste, a man wh0, like
himself, took delight in the thorough study of all the nobler
products of human genius and especially of Greek art and
knowledge, and who saw in such study the surest means of
rising to eminence in oratory and statesmanship. He was a man

an opposite opinion, as, effi, Antony, who, after originally con-
