specify. —multisque praeissem: I would have dictated to many
the formula for an action; an expression (often with an obJ'„ as
verb a, or carmen, orwith voce) used to denote the dictation‚
by the counsel, of the requisite words for introducing the suit. If
a plaintiff failed to state the complaint in the prescribed legal
terms he was non-suited. - interdicto: a judicia] order issued by
the Praetor in proceedings de possessione, forbidding all inter-
ference with the existing, state of things. — te ex iure . . . voea-
rent: call you out os court to enyaye in a struyyle,· a formal
challenge in the case of rival claims to property which could not
be moved. Originally the parties to such a suit actually went to
the disputed property, and in the presence of the Praetor engaged
in a struggle for its possession; the challenge survived as a legal
fiction3 cf. pro Mur. ll, 25, where Cicero introduces the formula:
Fundam qui est in ayro qm· Sabinus vocatur eqo ex iure Quiritium
meum esse ais‚· inde ibi eqo te ex iure manum consertum voc0.
Whereupon the defendant replies: Unde tu me ex iure manum
consertum vocasti, inde ibi eqo te revocO, etc. — consertum:
supine, see A. 3023 G. 435; H. 546.—1rrulsses: irrumpere
occurs in the same sense, ΙΙΙ. 27, 108, and 41, 165.

42. Agerent . . . lege: would brinq an action ayainst you.
i.e. by the same process. — ln iure: in courc‚· i.e. before the
Praetor; cf. GaiuS, 4, 96: ut nihil in iure vindicare possint.—
physici: Democritus and Pythagoras represent of course the pre-
Socratic period, when philosophy was mainly devoted to physical
inquiries. — ornati: the epithet transferred from the speech to the
speaker. — sacramento: each of the contending parties at the
commencement oi a process deposited a certain sum, called sa-
cramentum, which was forfeited to the public treasury by the
loser; hence iust0, a deposit made in a causa iusta, i.e. one
that would not be lost. A sacramentum iniustum is men-
tioned in pro Mil. 27, 74. -— greges: schools ; cf. de Fin. I. 20, 65:
Epicurus una in domo . . . tenuit amicorum yreyes ,· Lael. 19, 69:
in nostro ut ita dicam φερε. - fonte et eapite: source and foun-
min-head ‚· Intr. 9, 1, t: cf. 44, 195. For the position of Socrates
in philosophy, see ΙΙΙ. 16, 60, ff.; de Fin. ΙΙ. 1, 1. —de bonis
rebus . . . de malis: i.e. ethics‚· cf. Tusc. Disp. V. 4, 10:
Socrates autem primus philooophiam devocavit a caelo etin urbi-
