PREFAOE.

—000—

Tan text 01 131115 edition of De Oratore is that of Sorof,
with some changes in orthography and punctuation, and a
few slight differences of reading which will be found duly
discussed in the notes and the appendix. Ι have made free
use of the introduction, following it somewhat more closely
in the strictly historical parts3 but have added section 9
entire. In that discussion Ι have felt justified in giving some
emphasis 130 111)16131011, 6 1316113 01 Cicero’s style which has not
been adequately treated. In the commentary Ι have made
such omissions, additione, and adaptations as seemed called
for by the needs 01 1311056 students for whom this work is
especially desig-ned.

Ι take pleasure in gratefully acknowledging the courtesy ⁵

of Dr. Sorof in permitting me to use his edition as the basis
101· 131115 0116, and also his kindness in offering other valuable
assistance. The De Oratore has been a favorite field 101·

’ scholarly work, and the modern editor has an ample fund

01 111613611615, both critical and explanatory, upon which to
draw. N ext 130 Dr. Sorof, however, credit is here due to
Professor .A. S. Wilkins, 01 the Owens College, Manchester‚
whose excellent edition has been constantly before me.

I am greatly indebted to Professor Edmund Morris 'Hyde,
