mitted suicide by drinking vitriol.1 Antony was praetor, prob-
ably in 102, along with P. Marcius Philippus and Cn. Domitius
AhenobarbuS, and with proconsular power conducted an expe—
dition against the pirates of Cilicia, defeated them, and cele·
brated a triumph on his return to Rome. In 100 he was
among those who took a determined stand against SaturninuS,³²
and in 99 was consul,·with A. Postumius Albinus as colleague,
and offered a firm resistance to the popular tribune Sex. Titius ⁸,
in his advocacy of an agrarian law. In the following year he
successfully defended the consul of 101, M' Aquilius, prosecuted
by L. Fufius for extortion.⁴ He became censor in 97, in which
year he decorated the rostra⁶ with the booty won in the war
with the pirates, and upon it triumphantly defended himself
against an accusation of bribery⁶ brought by M. DuroniuS,
whom he had ejected from the Senate. Three years later he
undertook the defense of C. Ν orbanus,⁷ prosecuted under the
lex Appuleia de maiestate, by P. Sulpicius Rufus, who represented
the nobility. Undoubtedly by taking this defense upon himself,
and especially by the practice of the arts of sophistry‚⁸ to which
he resorted to secure the acquittal of his client, Antony rendered
a very doubtful service to his party 3 yet Norbanus would hardly
have been acquitted had not the equites wished to show their⁴
gratitude ⁹ for his appearance against Caepi0, who had sought
in 106 to deprive them of their judicial privilegeS, and whose
condemnation in 104 had been brought about through the
efforts of Norbanus.

Antony served as leyatus in the Social war, and in 89 was
among those accused under the Varian law de maiestate, but
was acquitted as the result oi the passionate eloquence of his
